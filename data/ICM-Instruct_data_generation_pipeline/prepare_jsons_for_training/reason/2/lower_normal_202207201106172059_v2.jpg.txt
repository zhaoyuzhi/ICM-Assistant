A man in a white sneaker and denim shorts with the word "new arrival" displayed at the bottom of the image. The man is standing on a concrete platform or ledge by the ocean, with a city skyline visible in the background. This image is not sexy due to the context of the man standing by the ocean and the city in the background. These elements create a more casual and relaxed atmosphere, rather than the typical "sexy" vibe that is associated with images like this. The man's attire, specifically the denim shorts, also has a casual and laid-back feel, further reinforcing the non-sexy nature of the image. The exposure level is low, which means there is very limited information about the man's body in the image. This reinforces the focus on the overall atmosphere rather than the subject's appearance.
