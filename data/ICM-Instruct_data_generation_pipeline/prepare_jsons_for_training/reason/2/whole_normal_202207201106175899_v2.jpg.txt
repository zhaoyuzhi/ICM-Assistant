The image depicts a young woman in a green dress standing next to a window. The dress appears to be of a modest style, and the exposure level of the image is low. The woman is positioned on the left side of the photo, with her hand resting on her hip. The window she is standing next to appears to be a part of a big glass building. The overall atmosphere of the image is not sexy, as it does not focus on the woman's body or her posture in a suggestive manner. Instead, the image showcases the woman's green dress and the setting of a building with a large window. The low exposure level also contributes to the non-sexual nature of the image. Based on the image content and the overall atmosphere, the image does not evoke any sensual or provocative feelings.
