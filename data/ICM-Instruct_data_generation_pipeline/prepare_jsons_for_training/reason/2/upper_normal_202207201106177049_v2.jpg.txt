The image features a woman who is the main subject. She is wearing a yellow blouse and a black skirt. The blouse has a collar and buttons down the front, while the skirt is fitted and has a slit on the left side. The woman is standing in front of a building with a glass facade and a tree in the background. The exposure level of the image is low, which means that the woman is not the focus of the image and the background is blurred. The overall atmosphere of the image is not sexy because the woman's pose and attire are not suggestive or provocative. The low exposure level and the blurred background also contribute to a non-sexual atmosphere. The image focuses more on the woman's outfit and the setting rather than her physical appearance.
