The image is a close-up of a person's buttocks, which are the main focus of the picture. The individual is wearing black and gold-striped underwear. The person's left leg is bent, providing a clear view of the thigh and buttock area. The image is often described as sexy due to several factors. Firstly, the close-up of the buttocks and the black and gold-striped underwear create a sense of intimacy and physical attraction. The contrasting colors of the underwear against the skin can be visually striking and appealing. Secondly, the pose, with the bent left leg, highlights the person's curves and overall shape, which can generate a sense of attractiveness and allure. Finally, the close-up view allows for a detailed examination of the person's body, emphasizing and accentuating the visual elements responsible for the image's perceived 'sexy' nature.
