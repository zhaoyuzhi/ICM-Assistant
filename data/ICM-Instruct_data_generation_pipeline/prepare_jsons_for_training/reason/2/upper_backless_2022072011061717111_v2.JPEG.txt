The overall atmosphere of the image is sexy, primarily because of the woman's confident pose and the attention to her appearance, even though she has her back bare. The blue jean skirt is a popular choice of clothing often associated with casual, comfortable wear and can be seen as a sign of self-assuredness. The purple top adds a pop of color to the scene, making it even more visually appealing.

This combination of clothing choices, body language, and the overall atmosphere contribute to a sexy appearance in the image.
