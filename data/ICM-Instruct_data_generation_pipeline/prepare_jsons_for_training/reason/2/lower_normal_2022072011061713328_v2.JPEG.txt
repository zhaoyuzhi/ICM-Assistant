In the image, there is a woman who is the main subject. She is wearing a long beige skirt that reaches her ankles. The skirt is made of a soft fabric, adding a casual and comfortable look to her outfit. On her feet, she has chosen flat shoes that complement her attire. The woman is in motion, walking on a sidewalk with a wooden surface. She is also carrying a purse on one shoulder, suggesting she might be out for a casual stroll or running errands. The image does not seem sexy due to several factors. One reason may be the woman's attire, which includes a long skirt and flat shoes. This gives off a casual and non-sexual appearance. Additionally, the exposure level of the woman is low, as we are looking at her from a side perspective, which means that only the woman's upper body is visible. This further emphasizes a non-sexual atmosphere in the image. Finally, the image does not contain any explicit or suggestive elements that would evoke a sexual context. The overall atmosphere of the image is casual and non-sexual, making it appropriate for viewers.
