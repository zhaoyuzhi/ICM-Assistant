The man in the image is wearing khaki cargo shorts and a white t-shirt. He is standing with his hands in his pockets and his back turned to the camera. The exposure level of the human in the image is low. The overall atmosphere of the image is casual and informal. The man's pose and the low exposure level suggest that this is a non-sexual image. It does not contain any elements that would be considered provocative or suggestive. The focus is on the man's clothing and posture rather than his physical appearance or suggestive poses. This image is not sexy based on the content and atmosphere of the picture.
