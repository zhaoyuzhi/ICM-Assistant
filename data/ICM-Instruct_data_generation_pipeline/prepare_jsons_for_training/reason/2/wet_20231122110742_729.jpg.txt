Their back is facing the camera, and the towel they're holding appears to be wrinkled. The image depicts a sense of sexy atmosphere mainly due to three factors - the person's attire, their actions, and the surrounding environment. The person's clothes are soaked, which suggests they have been enjoying themselves, and this can be perceived as attractive by some viewers. Additionally, the person's actions of holding a towel over their head and standing in the water could be seen as flirtatious or playful, further enhancing the image's allure. Lastly, the pool of water adds a sense of relaxation and leisure, which is also associated with feelings of sensuality and allure.
