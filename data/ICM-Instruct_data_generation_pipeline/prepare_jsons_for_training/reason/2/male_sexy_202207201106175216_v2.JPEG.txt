The man in the image is shirtless, with his chest exposed. He is wearing a pair of blue and white underwear. He is standing in a room, and there is a football in his hand. He is striking a pose with the football between his legs. The image is sexy due to the man's pose with the football in his hand, the overall atmosphere of the picture, and the fact that he is shirtless. Pose with a football (a common symbol of strength and masculinity) and wearing only underwear evokes a sense of allure and sensuality. Additionally, the man's shirtlessness and the fact that he is not wearing any additional clothing amplifies the sexual nature of the image.
