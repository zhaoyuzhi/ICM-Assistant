The woman in the image is wearing a pair of dark purple leggings with a lace-up front. Her attire consists of a purple sports bra and white sneakers. She is striking a pose with her leg up in the air and her arms extended to the side. The exposure level of the human in the image is very low, meaning that only a small portion of her body is visible. The atmosphere of the image is not sexy due to the low exposure level of the woman. The woman's attire and pose are not suggestive or provocative, and the overall focus of the image is on the woman's athletic attire and posture rather than on her physical appearance. The image does not include any explicit or inappropriate content that would be considered unsuitable for a general audience.
