The image shows a young woman and an older woman wearing suspender skirts and posing for a picture. The younger woman is wearing a black dress while the older woman is dressed in a red dress. Both women are smiling and appear to be enjoying the moment. The overall atmosphere of the image is playful and flirtatious. This is because of the reference to underwear and the description of the women as "pretty girls" or "beautiful" in the context of the slogan. The fact that they are posing for a picture together, smiling, and the way they are dressed adds to the impression of a lighthearted and suggestive scene. The image, combined with the slogan, creates a strong sense of sensuality and allure.
