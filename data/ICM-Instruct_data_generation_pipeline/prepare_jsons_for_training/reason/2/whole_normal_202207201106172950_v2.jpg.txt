The image shows a woman wearing a blue shirt and holding a phone in her hands. She is standing in a store with a tiled floor and glass display cases, and the background is blurred. The exposure level of the image is low, making it suitable for showing without issue. The image does not contain any explicit content and lacks the elements that would be considered "sexually suggestive". Therefore, it can be considered non-sexual based on the content and the overall atmosphere. The focus of the image is on the woman and her actions, rather than on provocative or adult content. The low exposure level, combined with the focus on the woman and her actions, contribute to the non-sexual atmosphere of the image.
