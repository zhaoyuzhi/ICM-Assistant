He is not in an overtly intimate or provocative pose. He does not seem to be interacting with the car in a sexual manner. The overall atmosphere of the picture is professional and formal. This image is not sexy because the man's attire, actions, and the overall setting are in line with a professional environment. The low exposure level further emphasizes that the focus is on the man's appearance and attire rather than his physical attractiveness. There is no explicit indication of a sexual nature in the scene. The presence of a briefcase implies a work-related context, which further reinforces the professional atmosphere.
