The woman's attire is not very modest, and her skirt shows her thighs, which can make the picture seem more intimate and sexy.

The overall atmosphere of the picture is suggestive and provocative. The woman's pose with her crossed legs, along with her attire, contributes to an image that appears to be intentionally designed to be erotic. The combination of her outfit, her pose, and the setting in the street creates an overall impression of a seductive and enticing image. This kind of image can evoke feelings of desire and attraction in the viewer, which is why it can be perceived as being sexy.
