The image shows two different shots of the same person, both in black sweatpants and a white sneaker. The woman in the first shot is standing with her hands on her hips, her legs slightly apart. She is facing straight ahead. The person in the second shot is sitting on a white background, with her legs crossed and her back straight. The woman is not wearing a shirt, and her stomach is exposed. Both people have similar poses and expressions. The image is not sexy because the woman is not wearing a shirt, which would suggest a more revealing or provocative outfit. Additionally, the exposure level is low and both people are facing straight ahead. There is no suggestive or provocative pose, and the atmosphere of the image does not give off a sexy vibe. The woman's pose and expression, along with the fact that she is wearing sweatpants and not a shirt, combined with the low exposure level, make this image not sexy.
