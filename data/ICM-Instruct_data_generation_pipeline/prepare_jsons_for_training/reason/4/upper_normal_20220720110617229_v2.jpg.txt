The image shows a person holding a bag filled to the brim with cubed corn. The person is wearing a white shirt and there's a watch on their wrist. They are holding the bag in their left hand. The image is quite low exposure and the focus is on the bag of corn. The overall atmosphere of the image is not sexy because it is a casual setting, there are no provocative details or revealing elements, and the focus is on the bag of corn, not on the person's body. The exposure level is also very low, which suggests that it is an appropriate and non-sexual image.
