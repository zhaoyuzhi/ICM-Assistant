The person in the image is wearing white pants with a white rope tied around the waist. The rope is securely knotted, and the person has their hands on the knots, holding the rope in place. The pants are loose-fitting and appear to be made of a lightweight fabric. The background is a plain white background, and the image has low exposure, making it an appropriate image. The overall atmosphere of the image is simple and unpretentious. The person's attire and the background's minimalistic design do not evoke any sense of seduction or allure. The low exposure level of the image adds to this feeling, as it reduces the focus on the person's body and more on the overall composition of the image. The rope around the waist adds an element of intrigue, but it does not make the image sexy in any way. The simplicity of the image is what makes it non-sexy, as it does not include any provocative elements or focus on the physical aspects of the person in the image.
