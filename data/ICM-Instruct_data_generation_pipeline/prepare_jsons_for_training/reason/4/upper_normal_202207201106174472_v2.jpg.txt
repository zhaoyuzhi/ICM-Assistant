The person is also wearing a black and pink backpack. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a store or a mall. The person is standing in front of a display with Chinese text on it. The overall atmosphere of the image is casual and everyday, rather than sexy. The image is not sexy because it depicts a casual, everyday scene rather than a provocative or intimate one. The person is dressed in a simple white shirt and black and pink accessories, and the focus is on their outfit rather than their body.

The overall atmosphere of the image is calm and ordinary, which is not conducive to a sexy impression.
