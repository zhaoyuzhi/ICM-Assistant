The human is standing in front of a green background with a white text that reads "-5 â„ƒ", which is the temperature in Celsius. The person is wearing a pair of gray sweatpants with a pattern and a black t-shirt. They have their hands in their pockets and are wearing white socks. The overall atmosphere appears to be casual and relaxed. The image is not sexy because it is a simple casual snapshot with no explicit body parts or provocative poses. The human is dressed in a comfortable and appropriate manner for the temperature indicated in the image. The focus of the image is not on the person's body but on the surrounding setting and the weather conditions. The overall atmosphere of the picture is calm and straightforward, which contributes to a non-sexual impression.
