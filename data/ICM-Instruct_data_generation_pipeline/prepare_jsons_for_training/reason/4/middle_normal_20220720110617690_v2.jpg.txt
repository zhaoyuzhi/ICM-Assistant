In the image, a person is standing against a white background, wearing a pair of black shorts. The shorts are described as "short" and have a "pocket" on the side. The person is also wearing a brown belt and a white shirt. The person's hand is tucked into their pocket and their left hand is placed on their hip. The overall atmosphere of the picture is simple and casual. This image is not sexy because it lacks the elements typically associated with a sexy image, such as a suggestive pose, close-up of the person's face, or revealing clothing. Instead, the image focuses on the person's outfit and posture, which is relatively innocent and unprovocative. The low exposure level and the casual attire also contribute to a non-sexual atmosphere.
