The image features a person standing on a street, leaning on a railing. The person is wearing blue shorts with the Coca-Cola logo on them, a white shirt, and a watch on their wrist. The exposure level of the image is very low. The overall atmosphere of the image is not sexy because the person's attire is casual, and their pose is relaxed and non-threatening. The low exposure level of the image reduces the focus on the person's physical appearance and instead emphasizes the casual, everyday setting. The Coca-Cola logo on the person's shorts also contributes to a more ordinary, everyday atmosphere rather than a suggestive or seductive one.
