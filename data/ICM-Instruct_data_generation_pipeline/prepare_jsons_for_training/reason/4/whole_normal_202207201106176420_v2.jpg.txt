In a triptych image, a woman wearing a blue long-sleeved bodysuit and white socks is captured. The woman is in a studio with a white seamless background. She is taking a selfie with her phone while striking a pose. In the background, there's a mannequin wearing a pink dress. The image does not appear sexy due to the low exposure level, which suggests that the image content is not focused on promoting sensuality or revealing clothing. Additionally, the overall atmosphere of the image is more focused on the woman's outfit and her pose rather than her physical appearance. The image seems to be more about showcasing the woman's outfit and style rather than highlighting her body or form. The white socks and blue bodysuit also contribute to the clean and professional appearance of the image, further emphasizing its focus on showcasing the outfit rather than the woman's body.
