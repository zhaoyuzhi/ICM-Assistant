In the image, a woman is posing with her legs crossed and a yellow top. She is sitting on a yoga mat, which is next to a window. Her hair is pulled back into a bun, and she is smiling. The exposure level of the image is very low. The overall atmosphere of the picture is not sexy because the woman is not the main focus of the image. The main focus is on the yoga mat and the window, which creates a sense of calm and serenity. The woman's pose is also not suggestive, as she is sitting with her legs crossed, which is a common pose for yoga or meditation. Further, the low exposure level contributes to a non-sexual atmosphere by not drawing attention to her form or appearance.
