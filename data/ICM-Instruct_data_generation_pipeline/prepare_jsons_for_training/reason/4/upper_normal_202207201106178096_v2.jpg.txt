The image features a woman who is the main subject. She is wearing a brown coat, a blue shirt, and a necklace. Her hair is styled in loose waves. She is standing in front of a building with a stone facade. The exposure level of the image is low, which means that the image is not overly revealing or explicit. The overall atmosphere of the image is not sexy because the woman's attire and pose are modest and appropriate. The low exposure level further contributes to the image's non-sexual nature. The woman's clothing and the setting of the image suggest a professional or formal context, rather than a provocative or sensual one.
