They are wearing a pair of blue jean capris, white sneakers, and a black sweatshirt. There is a blue wall in the background, a chair, and a couch.

The person is not focusing on the viewer, but rather on the furniture in the room. Additionally, there is no interaction with the body, which further contributes to the perception that the image is not sexy. The overall atmosphere of the image is casual and comfortable, emphasizing the everyday setting of a living room.
