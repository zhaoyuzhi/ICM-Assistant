The image features a pair of hands holding an origami piece that represents a woman's genitalia. The hands are positioned in a way that suggests the origami is being opened. The background is a gradient transitioning from pink to red. The image is considered sexy based on the combination of the depiction of the female genitalia as an origami and the white lotion imitating semen. These images play on the idea of sexual intercourse, leading to a provocative and sensual atmosphere. The use of origami, often associated with innocence and childhood, juxtaposed with the explicit representation of sexuality, creates a sense of shock and arousal, which adds to the overall allure of the image.
