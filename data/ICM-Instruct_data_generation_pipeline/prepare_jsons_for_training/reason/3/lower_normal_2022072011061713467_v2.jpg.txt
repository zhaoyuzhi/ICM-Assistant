The image shows a man wearing a pair of black sweatpants and white sneakers. The sweatpants have a drawstring waist, adding a casual style to the ensemble. The man's pose and outfit suggest a relaxed and comfortable vibe. The image is described as non-sexy because the exposure level of the human is very low. This means that only the upper half of the man is visible in the image. The focus is more on the sweatpants and sneakers rather than the man's skin or body, which contributes to the non-sexy atmosphere.
