The image shows a young woman in a white sweater and blue jeans walking past a window. She appears to be looking down, and the building she is walking in front of has a glass window. The exposure level of the image is low. The overall atmosphere of the picture is not sexy because the woman is simply walking and not in a suggestive pose. In addition, the image content is low-key and not explicitly provocative. The woman is dressed casually in a sweater and jeans, which adds to the non-sexual nature of the scene. The low exposure level of the image further reinforces the notion that the content is innocent and not intimate.
