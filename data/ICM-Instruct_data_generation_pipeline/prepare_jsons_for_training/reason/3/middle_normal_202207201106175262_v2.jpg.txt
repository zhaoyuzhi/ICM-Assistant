The image has a low exposure level, focusing on the lower half of the person's body. The image is not sexy because the focus is on the person's outfit and clothing rather than their body or physical appearance. The low exposure level and the fact that the person is wearing a pair of pants rather than something more revealing suggests that the image is not intended to be sexy. The overall atmosphere of the picture is neutral and relaxed, rather than promoting or emphasizing sexuality.
