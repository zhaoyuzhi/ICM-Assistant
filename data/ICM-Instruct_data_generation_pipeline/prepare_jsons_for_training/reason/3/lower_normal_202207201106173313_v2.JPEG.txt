In the image, there is a woman wearing a long skirt that is light green in color. The skirt has a pleated design and extends down to her ankles. She is also wearing black pants, which show through the skirt. The woman stands with her back to the camera, and her left hand is placed on her hip. The lower half of her body is hidden by the skirt, indicating a low exposure level. The image is not sexy because the woman's attire is modest and not revealing. Her outfit includes a light green skirt and black pants, which do not reveal her body contours. Additionally, her posture, with her back to the camera, does not give the impression of someone who is trying to allure attention. The overall atmosphere of the image is calm and unassuming.
