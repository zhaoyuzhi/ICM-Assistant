Additionally, the presence of the denim shorts and the person's skin tone, possibly tanned or light-skinned, add to the overall sensual atmosphere of the image. The contrast between the casual denim shorts and the skin tone creates a visual appeal that draws attention to the person's body and makes the image more alluring.
