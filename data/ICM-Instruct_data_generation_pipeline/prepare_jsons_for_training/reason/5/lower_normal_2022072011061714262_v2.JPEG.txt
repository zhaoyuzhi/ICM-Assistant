In the image, a person is captured in motion, walking on a sidewalk. The individual is dressed in black pants, a black jacket, and black and orange sneakers. The clothes give off a casual and sporty vibe. The person appears to be going about their day, perhaps running errands or heading to a meeting. The image does not contain any explicit or suggestive content that would classify it as a "sexually explicit image". The focus is on the person's movement and attire, rather than their body or the surrounding environment. The atmosphere is casual and everyday, with the person simply walking down the street, not engaging in any provocative or suggestive actions. This suggests that the image is in compliance with the appropriate level of exposure, maintaining a balance between revealing enough to show that it is a human figure, and keeping the focus on their actions and attire.
