In the image, a person is seen standing with their hands in their pockets. They are facing the camera with a slight smile on their face. They are wearing a pair of ripped jeans and a black shirt. Their feet are adorned with black and white sneakers, adding a casual flair to the overall look. Although the person is dressed in casual attire and is not wearing any revealing clothing, the image is not considered 'sexy' because the exposure level is very low. In an image with a low exposure level, only a small portion of the body is visible, which does not elicit sensual feelings or evoke the notion of 'sexy'. The person's pose and attire, however, contribute to the relaxed and casual atmosphere of the image.
