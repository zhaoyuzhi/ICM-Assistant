In the image, a woman is the central figure, standing upright with her left leg slightly advanced in front of her right. She is wearing a brown skirt that reaches down to her knees. On her feet, she has chosen tan boots that have a pointed toe and a strap around the ankle. Her right hand is placed on her hip, while her left hand is resting by her thigh. Her head is tilted slightly to the left, and she is looking directly at the camera, engaging the viewer. The image is not sexy because it focuses on the woman's attire and posture rather than her body. The woman is dressed in modest clothing and her pose is neutral, neither exaggerated nor provocative
