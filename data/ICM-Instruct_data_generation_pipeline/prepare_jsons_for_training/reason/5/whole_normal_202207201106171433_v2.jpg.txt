The woman in the image has dark pants and a white sweater on. She has her arms crossed, leaning against a pillar in a store. She is wearing sneakers and has her legs slightly apart. The overall atmosphere of the picture is not sexy because the woman is leaning against a pillar instead of posing in a provocative manner. The image is described as low exposure, which typically means it is not prominently displayed or lacks explicit content. This, combined with the woman's neutral stance and clothing, makes it clear that the image is not intended to be sexy or provocative.
