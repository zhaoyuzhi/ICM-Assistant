The man on the right is wearing a black sweatshirt with a green logo on it. He is wearing khaki cargo pants. Both men are smiling and looking directly at the camera. The exposure level of the image is low. The image is not sexy because it is a low-exposure image featuring two young men posing against a concrete wall, with their clothing and expressions not emphasizing any intimate or revealing aspects.
