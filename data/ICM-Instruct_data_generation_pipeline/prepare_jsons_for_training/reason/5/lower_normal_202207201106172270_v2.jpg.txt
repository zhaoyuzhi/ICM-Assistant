The image is a side-by-side comparison of a woman's pose in a black and white dress. The woman is standing with her hands placed behind her back, and she is wearing a short skirt. The dress is simple and the overall atmosphere of the image is neutral. The exposure level is low, and there is no distracting or revealing content in the image. The image is not sexy because it does not focus on the woman's body, but rather on her attire. The dress is plain and the exposure level is low, which suggests a non-sexual context. Additionally, the woman's pose and the neutral atmosphere of the image contribute to this perception of not being sensual.
