The image shows a person, whose lower body is shown in focus, wearing a pair of olive cargo shorts. The shorts have two pockets on the sides and a zipper on the bottom. The person also has one knee and one hand visible in the image. The exposure level of the image is very low, and it is an appropriate image. The overall atmosphere of the picture is not sexy because it primarily focuses on the person's lower body and lower half of their arms. While the shorts show some detail, the rest of their upper body and upper halves of their arms are not visible, making it a more casual and neutral image rather than a suggestive or seductive one. The exposure level is low and appropriate for the content, which implies that the image is meant to be a casual, everyday depiction rather than a provocative one.
