Based on the image content, the woman's outfit and her pose give a sexy vibe. The strapless dress and midriff-baring style can be considered as "sexy" because it reveals a significant amount of skin and is often associated with lustful or alluring appearances.

The serene setting of the body of water in the background further contributes to a "sexy" atmosphere.
