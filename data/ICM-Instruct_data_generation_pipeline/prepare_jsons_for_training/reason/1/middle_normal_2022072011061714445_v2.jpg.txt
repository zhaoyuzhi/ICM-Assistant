The image depicts a person wearing olive green cargo pants and a beige shirt. Their hands are crossed on their chest, and they are standing with their back to the camera. The image has a low exposure level, suggesting it is an appropriate image. The overall atmosphere of the picture is not sexy because the person is dressed in casual and neutral clothing, with no exposed skin or revealing details. The setting appears to be indoor and there are no exaggerated or provocative poses. The image focuses on the person's attire and posture rather than their physical attributes, which contributes to a non-sexual impression.
