The image features a person standing against a white background, dressed in a pair of white wide leg trousers. The trousers have a crease down the front and appear to be made of a lightweight fabric. The person is wearing a tan belt with a gold buckle, which is tied around the waist. On their left wrist, they are wearing a bracelet. The overall atmosphere of the photo is simple and uncluttered. The image is not sexy as it features a person in a neutral, everyday outfit rather than anything provocative or revealing. The low-key, white background further contributes to the lack of intensity in the image. The focus on the person's attire and the absence of any distinctive elements in the background keep the scene from becoming sexually suggestive. Additionally, there are no people, only a single individual is featured in the image, which also contributes to the lack of sensuality.
