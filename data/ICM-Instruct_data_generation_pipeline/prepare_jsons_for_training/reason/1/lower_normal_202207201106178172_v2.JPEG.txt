The image shows a woman standing in front of a building with her arms crossed. She is wearing a black top and a long skirt. Her bare legs are visible from the low angle of the shot. She is wearing sandals which have a gold heel. The image does not contain any explicit or suggestive content, and the exposure level is appropriate. The woman's pose, clothing, and the overall atmosphere of the image are not sexy. The image focuses on the woman as a subject, rather than on her appearance, which contributes to its appropriate level of exposure.
