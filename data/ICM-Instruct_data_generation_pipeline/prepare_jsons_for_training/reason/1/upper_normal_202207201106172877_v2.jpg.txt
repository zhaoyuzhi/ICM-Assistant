The image features a woman who is the main subject. She is wearing a pink t-shirt that has a graphic design on it. The design includes a heart and the words "I'm affected" written in white. The woman is also wearing black pants and has long hair. She is standing in a room with a wooden floor and a white wall in the background. The exposure level of the image is low, which means that the woman is not the main focus of the image. The overall atmosphere of the image is not sexy because the woman is not posing in a provocative manner. Instead, she is standing in a neutral position with her hands placed on her hips. The low exposure level of the image also contributes to the non-sexy atmosphere, as it does not focus on the woman's body or clothing in a way that would be considered suggestive or provocative. The image is more focused on the woman's expression and the overall setting of the room.
