The beige color of the boots and tights also adds to the sexy atmosphere, as it is a neutral color that can evoke a sense of elegance and sophistication. Overall, the image of the person wearing tights and putting on a high-rise boot is sexy, as it captures the allure and mystery that is often associated with stockings and high-rise boots.
