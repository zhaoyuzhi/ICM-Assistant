A girl is shown from the waist downwards in a full length photograph. She is wearing a pair of blue leggings that has an opening in the center. The leggings cover her lower body and are held up by a black waistband. Her legs are slightly apart, and her arms are relaxed at her sides. There is no text present in the image. The image is sexy because of the girl's exposed midriff. The blue leggings and black waistband contrast with her skin, drawing attention to her waist and creating a sense of intimacy. The overall atmosphere of the image is casual and relaxed, with no other objects or visual elements to distract from the woman's lower body.
