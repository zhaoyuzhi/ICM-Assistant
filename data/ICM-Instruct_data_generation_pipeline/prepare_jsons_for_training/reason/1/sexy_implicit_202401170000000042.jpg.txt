The red color of the origami and the red paint on the fingernails add to the overall allure of the image. The image is described as being sexy as it uses a combination of implied nudity, the placement of hands to resemble female private parts, and the use of red origami and nail polish. These elements work together to create a seductive and suggestive atmosphere.

The red color of both the origami and the nail polish further enhances the visual allure, making the image appear more provocative and intriguing.
