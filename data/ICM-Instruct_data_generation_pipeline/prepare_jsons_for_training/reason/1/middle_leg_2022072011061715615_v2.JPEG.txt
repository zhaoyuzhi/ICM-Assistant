The image features a mannequin with a pair of legs, and on the mannequin's body, there is a beige skirt. The skirt is full-length and sits between the mannequin's hip and knee. The skirt appears to be made of a soft material, possibly cotton or linen, and it is gathered at the waist with a zipper running down the back, suggesting that it can be worn with a zipper. The overall focus of the image is on the skirt and its design, rather than the mannequin's body or the background
