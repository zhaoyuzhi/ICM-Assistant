The image features a topless man wearing a pair of red or maroon colored underwear that has the word "Goodman" written on it. He is standing next to an open box that contains two more pairs of similar underwear. This image is sexy due to several factors. The man's body posture and the fact that he is topless create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability. The close proximity of his body to the box of underwear suggests that the man might be in the process of trying on the garments, which can be seen as an invitation for the viewer to imagine him wearing the underwear. Furthermore, the red or maroon color of the underwear adds a bold and contrasting element to the image, which can be perceived as sexy by some viewers.
