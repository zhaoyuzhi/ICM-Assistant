A woman wearing white sweatpants with the word "Herbalife" written on the leg, a white shirt, and a white cap, is walking down a gray staircase. The woman is turning her head left and pointing a finger. The image is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the stairs and the woman's silhouette against the staircase. The overall atmosphere of the image is neutral and focused on the woman's movements and attire rather than her appearance, which might make some people perceive it as "sexy". However, this is not the intention of the image and the exposure level is very low, which suggests that it is an appropriate image. The priority is to capture the woman's actions and attire, rather than her appearance, making it a non-sexual image.
