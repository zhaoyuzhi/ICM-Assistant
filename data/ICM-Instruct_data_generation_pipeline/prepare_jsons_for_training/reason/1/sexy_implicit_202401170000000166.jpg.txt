The image shows two orange slices with their peels facing upwards, set against a white background. The pulp and peel of the orange are easily reminiscent of women's breasts and underwear, with sexual implications. This is because the shape and form of the orange slices resemble the contours and silhouettes of the female body, particularly the chest and undergarments. The close-up nature of the image further emphasizes these comparisons. The overall atmosphere of the image is sensual and provocative due to these visual similarities and the association of the orange with the female body. This is why the image is considered sexy based on its content and overall atmosphere.
