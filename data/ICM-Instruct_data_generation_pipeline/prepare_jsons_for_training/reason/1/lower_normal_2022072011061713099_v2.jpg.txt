The woman in the image is standing with her arms crossed, wearing a beige dress. She is also wearing strappy heels and a white purse. The image has a calm and low-key atmosphere. The image is not sexy because it is a professional portrait showing the woman's attire and accessories. The attire and positioning of the woman suggest a more formal or professional setting as opposed to a sexy vibe. The low exposure level further enhances this impression of a non-sexual image.
