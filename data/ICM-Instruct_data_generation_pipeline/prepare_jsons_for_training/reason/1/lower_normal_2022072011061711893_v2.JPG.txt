In the image, there is a woman standing next to a wooden dresser. She is wearing a long, green dress that reaches down to her ankles. The dress has a high neckline and is made of a shiny fabric with a slight sheen to it. The woman's attire and the setting suggest a formal or semi-formal event. The image does not contain any explicit or suggestive content, and the woman's posture and attire are not overly revealing. The overall atmosphere of the image is modest and appropriate, and therefore, it can be classified as a non-sexy image. The focus is on the woman's clothing and the setting rather than on her physical appearance, which contributes to the image's appropriate nature.
