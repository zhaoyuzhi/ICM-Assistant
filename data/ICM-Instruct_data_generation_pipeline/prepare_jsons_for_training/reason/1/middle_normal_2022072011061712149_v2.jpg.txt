The image features a person wearing blue and white shorts with a tropical print pattern, including palm trees, swim ladders, and slides. The individual's hand is visible in the frame, holding the shorts. The exposure level of the image is low, making it an appropriate image to provide a detailed description of the person's attire and movements. The overall atmosphere of the picture is not sexy due to its low exposure level, which indicates that it may have been taken in a private or non-public setting rather than in a bold, sexual context. Additionally, the clothing, specifically the blue and white swim shorts, is more casual and relaxed rather than provocative. The tropical print pattern on the shorts adds to the playful and lighthearted mood of the image, which further contributes to the overall non-sexy atmosphere.
