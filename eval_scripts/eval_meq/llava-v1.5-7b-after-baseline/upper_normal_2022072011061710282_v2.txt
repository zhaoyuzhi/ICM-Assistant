Algorithm content:
The image features a person wearing a purple and white striped polo shirt. The person is sitting on a chair, and their face is not visible in the image. The exposure level of the image is low, and it is an appropriate image. The overall atmosphere of the image is not sexy because the person's face is not visible, and the focus is on the person's attire rather than their physical appearance. The low exposure level and the appropriate nature of the image suggest that it is not meant to be provocative or sensual. The image is more focused on the person's clothing and posture rather than their physical appearance, which contributes to the non-sexy atmosphere.
